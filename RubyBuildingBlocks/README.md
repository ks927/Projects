# Ruby Building Blocks

### Caesar Cipher

Takes a letter or string and a number as arguments, and returns the string or letter shifted up or down the alphabet as many times as indicated by the number given. Ignores special cases such as lower and upper case letters, spaces, and puncuation. Included are tests that test each case.

    caesar_cipher("What a string!", 3)
    
    ->"Zkdw d vwulqj!"


### Enumerables

Creates an Enumerable module that contains methods for several enumerable functions. Included are tests for my_each, select, my_count, and my_all.
