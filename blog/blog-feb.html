    <h4>Week 4 - Bubble Sort</h4>

    <p>Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm used in programming that takes an array of items and places them in order. I came into this week with a pretty high level of intimidation and apprehension for this assignment because of bubble sort's reputation. It gets tossed around as a programming interview question that strikes fear into the minds of young coders. Needless to say, I've avoided and haven't looked forward to meeting it. The idea of the function, and in fact conceptualizing it, is not the hard part. You have two numbers next to each other. If the one to the left is greater than the one to the right, they switch. This continues until the greatest number is all the way to the right, the lowest is at the left, and the array is in order. My pseudocode looked good to me after a few minutes of reasoning out the steps, but I struggled with some of the Ruby syntax at first. That is until I googled, and found, a neat little trick for swapping x and y variables. Lets walk through the code:</p>
    <p>First we initialize a flag variable, and set it to true, to tell us whether the looping is done. Next we have to do a 2-dimensional each_with_index loop. As the array is being looped over with the first .each, the second .each is looping over every item and checking to see if each inside index is greater than the outside index. If so, they are swapped with that Ruby magic I discovered. Within this if statement, I set flag to false, so I know that the loop is occuring.</p>
    <p>Once out of the if statement, I double check that my loop performed what I wanted it to by resetting my flag to true, and printing the properly sorted array at the end.</p>
