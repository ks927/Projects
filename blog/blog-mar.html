    <h4>Week 9 - Data Structures</h4>

<p>Unlike the previous two weeks, which gave me trouble despite being familiar from prior independent studies, this week’s concepts introduced a new anxiety. As we are exploring more of the world of computer science, I am having more and more trouble finding what it is we are making the computer do. For example, when I started out, I was mainly studying HTML/CSS and JavaScript. This was all done in the browser, thus I could see the results of what I was doing instantly. Even when TOP switched over to Ruby and I started with the command line and files, I could see that I was taking input from the user, opening files and manipulating their data, and returning information to the user. </p>

<p>This week, however, I lost my way. The lesson was on data structures, and there were three projects(practice problems) with a relatively sparse amount of material on the subject. I think I made the mistake of attempting the projects before fully understanding the topic so I will try to explain it here, in retrospect. A data structure, in the simplest terms, is an organized way to store data for your application. The two types we focused on were <em>linked lists</em> and <em>binary trees</em>. After a lot of hunting, I finally found an explanation that described linked lists in plain English <a href=“http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/128520/what-are-concrete-rules-for-using-a-linked-list-instead-of-an-array”>here</a>. </p>

    <p>Basically, as I understand it, the main difference between an array and a linked list is that you can add new items to the LL without having to make a new copy of it, unlike an array. This is done with the LL's node and pointer system. Each value in the list sits on a node, and points to the next node, with the final node pointing to nil. If you want to add a new value, you just make the node before it point to it, and have the new node point to the node after it. Here is a visualization of [1, 2, "dog", 365] as a linked list: </p>

    <p>(1) -> (2) -> ("dog") -> (365) -> nil</p>

    <p>Here is my linked lists project <a href="https://github.com/ks927/Projects/blob/master/linked_list/linked_list.rb">GitHub</a></p>

    <p>Next up was the binary tree. The best way to describe this data structure is for me to compare it to the linked list. While the linked list is a linear structure, meaning each node points to one other item in a single, possibly long line, binary trees' nodes can point to two nodes at a time. This allows for much faster search times. Here's a visual example taken from a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2130416/what-are-the-applications-of-binary-trees">Stack Overflow answer</a> </p>

    <code><pre> LINKED LIST sorted alphabetically
     Alice
    /     \
   =       Bob
       /   \
      =     Chloe
           /     \
          =       David
                 /     \
                =       Edwina
                       /      \
                      =        Frank
                              /     \
                             =       =
    </pre></code>

    <code><pre> BINARY TREE sorted length-wise from the root
               Chloe
            ___/     \___
         Bob             Edwina
        /   \           /      \
   Alice     =      David        Frank
  /     \          /     \      /     \
 =       =        =       =    =       =
    </pre></code>

    <p>In the first code example, if you wanted to find Frank, you would have to traverse six nodes to get to him. This is a linked list that is sorted alphabetically from Alice to Frank. In the second example, it would only take you three nodes. This one's a little more complicated. If the name is shorter than the root(Chloe) it gets moved the left, while if it's longer then it gets moved to the right. Subsequently, if it is shorter or longer than the next node, these same steps are followed until it gets placed. It is added complexity, but you can see the advantage. Here is my binary search project <a href="https://github.com/ks927/Projects/blob/master/Data_Structures/binary_trees.rb">GitHub</a></p>

    <p>And with that I think I've regained my footing in the world of computer science. No one can explain things better than you can to yourself. I have no doubt I'll get lost again next week. </p>

    <h4>Week 8 - Recursion</h4>
    <p>
        Recursion is the programming concept of calling a function from within itself. In effect this creates a loop of endless function calls if there is no condition stated that will end the program at a certain point. It is not extremely common to use recursion (thank God!) but it is very handy to know. Often times an iterator of some sort will suffice, but there are times when recursion will provide a more elegant solution.</p>

    <p>There is no better way to explain than to jump into some code…</p>
<code><pre>def factorial(n)
    return 1 if n <= 0
    n * factorial(n-1)
end</pre></code>
    <p>This is a factorial function that uses recursion. If you call factorial(5), within the program it will do 5 * factorial(4). This will then go a level deeper; meaning factorial(4) will get called and the function will run 4 * factorial(3). Again factorial(3) will get called and 3 * factorial(2) will get run. Then 2 * factorial(1) and finally 1 * factorial(0). Because we stated within the function to return 1 if n <= 0, the program does not blow the stack, but returns 1 when it reaches 0. 5*4*3*2*1 is output and we get 120.</p>

    <code><pre>def fib(n)
    return 0 if n == 0
    return 1 if n == 1
    fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
end</pre></code>
    <p>Here is a much more complicated program. The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers starting from 1 that adds the previous 2 numbers  to get the next number. For instance, 1+0 is 1 (0, 1, 1), 1+1 is 2 (0, 1, 1, 2), 2+1 is 3 (0, 1, 1, 2, 3) and so on.</p>
    <p>In this function, if we input a 5, we get fib(4) + fib(3). This then gets broken down into a two-sided problem. On the left side we'll have fib(3)+fib(2). Again, this gets broken down. Fib(2) leaves us with fib(1)+fib(0) or just 1 and 0. Fib(3) becomes fib(2)+fib(1) but then fib(1) leaves us with 1. Fib(2) breaks down into fib(1)+fib(0) which gives us a 1 and a 0. On the left side of this problem we count up the amount of 1s that are left: which is 3. </p>
    <p>Now we can go back to the right side of the original input. fib(3) becomes fib(2)+fib(1). Fib(1) gives us a 1. Fib(2) gives us fib(1)+fib(0) or a 1 and a 0. On the right side we are left with 2 1s. After adding up the left side and the right side, we conclude that the fifth number in the fibonacci sequence is 5.</p>



    <p>Like last week’s lesson, this was another section that I studied and struggled with during my JavaScript days prior to TOP. Again, I did not enter the lesson discouraged. Instead, I was actually eager to possibly gain new perspectives on the topic and break through previous limitations I had while attempting to grasp the concept. The material TOP provided, in addition to practice problems, the project, and writing this blog have made me more confident in dealing with recursive methods, though I am still far from an expert.</p>
