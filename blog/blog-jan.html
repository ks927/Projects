<h3><strong>The Odin Project-Blog Post 1</strong></h3>
    <datetime>January 16 2017</datetime>
    <strong>Week 1 - “Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of the trigger.”</strong>
    <p>About five months ago I began teaching myself to code in hopes of a career as a front end a developer. When I started, I thought if I put in several hours everyday and followed a study guide with tutorials, I’d be on my way to employable in around half a year. By the time the holidays hit, however, reality set in. I had finished up my path, lost my way, and knew I needed something more. The fundamentals were like second nature, but I needed the next step. I extensively researched coding bootcamps. They seemed to be a 0-100 course of action. Not to mention tuition costs close to $20,000 and none in my area of the country. I was more on the hunt for something that would give me a taste of what a real developer does and help me <em>build a portfolio</em>. Considering where I was in my learning, and where I am geographically, I decided a bootcamp might not be the best option. I asked around on reddit and my thoughts were confirmed. One of those reddit threads led me to The Odin Project.</p>
    <p>My only experience with TOP (which I will from here on out refer to it as) up to that point was at the beginning of my journey. I remember hearing about it, giving it a cursory glance, and thinking that it was beyond my level of comprehension. Returning to it after a few months of studying, however, seemed like perfect timing. It is a projects-based, bootcamp style curriculum created by alumni of App Academy. And the best part is it’s free! So with new renewed vigor, I began a new journey, and will be chronicling it weekly here.</p>
    <strong>Conquering My Fear of the Command Line</strong>
    <p>I love that TOP begins with a course on the command line, because through all of my studying, it is the one thing I knew was absolutely essential but was always afraid of tackling. No other study guide I’ve followed has provided adequate command line material until this one. The first section teaches you how to navigate your computer’s file system, create directories and files, make copies of and remove those files. This leads right into the next section which is on Git and GitHub. Now that I am finally competent using the command line and Git, I’m starting to feel like an actual coder.</p>
    <strong>Devtools and the Front End</strong>
	<p>The subcategory following Git is the Front End. These are tools and languages that I am familiar with and have been studying since the summer, so while I was able to traverse this section rather quickly, the real value was in the projects. The first project of TOP is to redo the Google homepage using HTML and CSS. Simple enough. But the fact that it is not a tutorial and no one is holding your hand along the way is what makes it special. You are forced to put what you know into practice and the frustration of creating a webpage pays off in the end with a huge confidence boost.</p>
    <p>The second project is to build an etch-a-sketch tool using JavaScript and jQuery, which I will be getting to at the beginning of week 2.</p>

    </ul>

<h3>January 5 2017</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Design patterns</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Singleton pattern</li>
                <li>Mediator pattern - it's like the "flight tower" of your workflow</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Tried and failed to complete a CodeWars problem but got valuable pseudocoding practice</li>
        <li>Worked on blog</li>
            <ul>
                <li>added month name to header of each page</li>
                <li>added margins to body</li>
                <li>fooled around with index page CSS for awhile</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Today was one of the days where I worked for seven or eight hours, but I feel like I barely accomplished anything. I can attribute this feeling to three reasons:
    <ol>
        <li>I had a hard time grasping the design patterns I studied.</li>
        <li>I spent over an hour trying to hack a CodeWars problem but eventually had to unlock the solutions.</li>
        <li>I spent the majority of my evening grinding my teeth and trying to get the index page of the blog right - unfinished business.</li>
    </ol>
    However, I did research <a href="http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/">The Firehose Project</a>, an online coding bootcamp that looks like a could be a viable option moving forward.</p>

<h3>January 4 2017</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Created the January page and changed the a:hover effects</li>
        <li>Read about and practiced the module design pattern</li>
        <code><pre>//Module Pattern
var cartModule = (function () {
    //privates
    var cart = [];

    return {
    //return object exposed to the public
    addItem: function(items) {
        cart.push(items);
    },
    countItem: function() {
        return cart.length;
    }

  };
})();
cartModule.addItem("bread");
cartModule.addItem("soap");
cartModule.addItem("beer");
console.log(cartModule.countItem());//3
console.log(cartModule.cart)//undefined because it's private
</pre></code>
        <li>And the Revealing module pattern</li>
        <code><pre>//The Revealing Module Pattern
var fellowship = (function() {

    var quest = "adventure";

    var members = function(mems){
        return " " + mems + " are going on the " + quest;
    }

    return {

        setMembers: members,
        setQuest: quest

    };
})();

console.log(fellowship.setMembers("The fellowship"));//The fellowship are going on the adventure</pre></code>
    </ul>

var server = http.createServer(function(request, response){
    console.log("server was created" + request.url);

        response.end(JSON.stringify(dolphins));

});

server.listen(8000);
console.log("listening to localhost 8000");</pre></code>
