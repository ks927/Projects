    <h4>Week 2 - Etch-a-Sketch and Learning Ruby</h4>
    <h4>Etch-a-Sketch</h4>

    <p>I began week 2 applying my jQuery/JavaScript to a neat little etch-a-sketch project. It was the first time in my learning that I was able to combine code with markup, and the sense of achievement I felt when I got it to work was even more rewarding than the google page. The hardest part for me was actually generating the grid via code without any HTML or CSS. The trick was a 2-dimensional loop, followed by stylizing each div square with jQuery by dividing the height and width of the whole grid by the size of the div square that was passed into the loop (link to the code below). The other functions were pretty straightforward thanks to the magic of jQuery. My code can be found here <a href="https://github.com/ks927/Projects/tree/master/etch-a-sketch">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>Like I mentioned last week, the merit in TOP is in its projects, and I find myself constantly checking to see how close I am to the next one. It’s what motivates me to spend hours everyday reading, watching videos, completing tutorials, or whatever it takes to get to the next project. Luckily, they're sprinkled in the curriculum in between every few sections.</p>

    <h4>Learning Ruby</h4>

    <p>Thus, I knew I had two more sections before the next one. So I set to work at learning my first new programming language since the summer - Ruby. This entailed completing the entire Ruby track on Codecademy, which took much longer than expected, and two days of following tutorials normally would have sapped whatever momentum I picked up from the etch-a-sketch project.</p>
    <p>However, learning Ruby fueled a different fire for me. While it is a back end language unlike JavaScript, and much of the syntax is dissimilar, the general rules and ideas are essentially the same. There are strings, arithmetic operations, arrays, objects (called hashes), and functions (called methods). The loops are where I had and continue to have a little bit of trouble because of how different the syntax is and how many types there are. But overall, it seems to be a much more human-friendly and beginner-friendly programming language because of how it reads like English. So far, and I know it’s still early, I think I enjoy coding in Ruby more than I’ve enjoyed JavaScript. Let’s hope that continues.</p>

    <p>Currently, I am working on the first Ruby project which is a combination of Ruby and the RSpec testing framework. Look for that in the week 3 post.</p><a>

<h3><strong>The Odin Project-Blog Post 1</strong></h3>
    <datetime>January 16 2017</datetime>
    <br>
    <h4>Week 1 - “Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of the trigger.”</h4>
    <p>About five months ago I began teaching myself to code in hopes of a career as a front end a developer. When I started, I thought if I put in several hours everyday and followed a study guide with tutorials, I’d be on my way to employable in around half a year. By the time the holidays hit, however, reality set in. I had finished up my path, lost my way, and knew I needed something more. The fundamentals were like second nature, but I needed the next step. I extensively researched coding bootcamps. They seemed to be a 0-100 course of action. Not to mention tuition costs close to $20,000 and none in my area of the country. I was more on the hunt for something that would give me a taste of what a real developer does and help me <em>build a portfolio</em>. Considering where I was in my learning, and where I am geographically, I decided a bootcamp might not be the best option. I asked around on reddit and my thoughts were confirmed. One of those reddit threads led me to The Odin Project.</p>
    <p>My only experience with TOP (which I will from here on out refer to it as) up to that point was at the beginning of my journey. I remember hearing about it, giving it a cursory glance, and thinking that it was beyond my level of comprehension. Returning to it after a few months of studying, however, seemed like perfect timing. It is a projects-based, bootcamp style curriculum created by alumni of App Academy. And the best part is it’s free! So with new renewed vigor, I began a new journey, and will be chronicling it weekly here.</p>
    <h4>Conquering My Fear of the Command Line</h4>
    <p>I love that TOP begins with a course on the command line, because through all of my studying, it is the one thing I knew was absolutely essential but was always afraid of tackling. No other study guide I’ve followed has provided adequate command line material until this one. The first section teaches you how to navigate your computer’s file system, create directories and files, make copies of and remove those files. This leads right into the next section which is on Git and GitHub. Now that I am finally competent using the command line and Git, I’m starting to feel like an actual coder.</p>
    <h4>Devtools and the Front End</h4>
	<p>The subcategory following Git is the Front End. These are tools and languages that I am familiar with and have been studying since the summer, so while I was able to traverse this section rather quickly, the real value was in the projects. The first project of TOP is to redo the Google homepage using HTML and CSS. Simple enough. But the fact that it is not a tutorial and no one is holding your hand along the way is what makes it special. You are forced to put what you know into practice and the frustration of creating a webpage pays off in the end with a huge confidence boost.</p>
    <p>The second project is to build an etch-a-sketch tool using JavaScript and jQuery, which I will be getting to at the beginning of week 2.</p>

<h3>January 5 2017</h3>
    <ul>

                <li>fooled around with index page CSS for awhile</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Today was one of the days where I worked for seven or eight hours, but I feel like I barely accomplished anything. I can attribute this feeling to three reasons:
    <ol>
        <li>I had a hard time grasping the design patterns I studied.</li>
        <li>I spent over an hour trying to hack a CodeWars problem but eventually had to unlock the solutions.</li>
        <li>I spent the majority of my evening grinding my teeth and trying to get the index page of the blog right - unfinished business.</li>
    </ol>
    However, I did research <a href="http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/">The Firehose Project</a>, an online coding bootcamp that looks like a could be a viable option moving forward.</p>

<h3>January 4 2017</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Created the January page and changed the a:hover effects</li>
        <li>Read about and practiced the module design pattern</li>
        <code><pre>//Module Pattern
var cartModule = (function () {
    //privates
    var cart = [];

    return {
    //return object exposed to the public
    addItem: function(items) {
        cart.push(items);
    },
    countItem: function() {
        return cart.length;
    }

  };
})();
cartModule.addItem("bread");
cartModule.addItem("soap");
cartModule.addItem("beer");
console.log(cartModule.countItem());//3
console.log(cartModule.cart)//undefined because it's private
</pre></code>
        <li>And the Revealing module pattern</li>
        <code><pre>//The Revealing Module Pattern
var fellowship = (function() {

    var quest = "adventure";

    var members = function(mems){
        return " " + mems + " are going on the " + quest;
    }

    return {

        setMembers: members,
        setQuest: quest
