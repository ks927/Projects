# Hangman Game 

This is a command line, hangman game using object oriented programming in the Ruby language. When the program is initialized, the user is prompted with three options. Depending on his/her response, a method within the Game class is run. If the user elects to play, the Play method of the class is called. Play is a loop that interacts with the user until the game is won, lost, or saved. The game also includes save and load features. The marshaling library is used to the serialize and deserialize the data so that it can be saved and loaded. 

The program was built as part of The Odin Project curriculum to incorporate working with the I/O of files and serialization in addition to building upon the OOP lesson.
