# Hangman Game 

This is a command line, hangman game using object oriented programming in the Ruby language. When the program is initialized, the user is presented with three options and depending on his/her response, a method is run. The main method of the Game class is the play loop. Play, which takes into it every other method of the class, interacts with the user, until the game is won, lost, or saved. 

The program was built as part of The Odin Project curriculum to incorporate working with the I/O of files and serialization in addition to building upon the OOP lesson.
