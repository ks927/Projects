<h1>My Simple Coding Blog</h1>
        <datetime>December 9 2016</datetime>
    <p>My name is Kyle Sheehan. I'm an aspring developer studying JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In order to hold myself accountable, I've been logging my daily grind in a notebook for the past few months. I figured it was past time to convert that to something digital. Most of what you will see here is barebones, bulletpoint summaries of what I spent hours studying. I may make an effort to flesh out future posts, but for now, here is my simple coding blog. </p>

<h3>December 9 2016 </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Created this blog!</li>
        <li>Completed Filtered ls exercise on nodeschool.io - learned how to loop through a file directory and return a filtered list of files by their path names.</li>
    </ul>
    <code><pre>var fs = require('fs');
var path = require('path');

var fileDir = process.argv[2];
var extName = '.' + process.argv[3];
fs.readdir(fileDir, function(err, files){
    if(err)
        throw err;
    files.forEach(function(file){ //loop through files
        if(path.extname(file) === extName){
    console.log(file); //if extname of the file is == extName, log that file.
        }
    });
});
        </pre></code>

<h3>December 8 2016</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Finished watching Ryan Dahl's Nodejs tutorial</li>
        <li>Completed My First Async I/O on nodeschool.io</li>
        <li>Researched potential bootcamps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>App Academy seems like the best suited for my situation being that it is in New York City, essentially free ($5000 deposit that they refund + 20% of first year's salary), and has amazing reviews due to a high job placement rate. However, it could be the most selective and difficult to get into.<br>
    Launch Academy also sounds tempting, and searches claim they have a campus in Philadelphia which would immediately put it at the top of my list. But their site is only showing Boston and an online option right now, and $15,000 on top of relocating may not be feasible for me at the moment.<br>
    More research and introspection needed.</p>
