# Simple Web Server and Client

### Description

This project uses the Ruby programming language to connect a simple web server to a client. The SimpleServer is written to receive and respond to requests made from the TinyWebBrowser.

### Running

To begin, in one tab of the terminal, run SimpleServer.rb.

In another tab, requests can be made to the server by running TinyWebBrowser.rb. As the code currently reads, GET requests on the client side will print response headers as well as the body of the index.html file. Client-side POST requests on the command line will ask for a name and email and place it in a hash. This hash gets yielded in the thanks.html file, which is printed in addition to the POST response headers. 

### Acknowledgments

This is my solution to the Ruby on the Web project provided by The Odin Project http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-on-the-web?ref=lc-pb 

I had plenty of help from the other student solutions on that page.
