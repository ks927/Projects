###What I learned

Building upon past knowledge, I am now including real code into my projects ontop of the static webpages while always reinforcing my git and terminal skills.
This project was all about generating large quantities of elements without using HTML, and then regenerating those elements from user input. I learned how valuable dev tools can be when you get stuck.
